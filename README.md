Web Dev Course Github Practice #2

This repository is a practice session. Just getting used to working with Github and the different aspects of the system. Learning how to clone, git ignore, branching and merging and all kinds of other things...

In practice 1 I was getting used to working with local git, this practice2 session is about getting used to creating new repositories directly on github and also creating new files, editing, etc.
